I would call him severally to make several minute changes and he would work on them within my timelines. I highly recommend Mr. Sagala to anyone who would like quality work done."

He is hungry for knowledge and can grasp multiple topics in a relatively short period of time. He is a perfectionist and will iterate a product until it is done to the right standard."

He sets high standards for himself in that even when one is tempted to settle on mediocre designs, he is still willing to rip everything up to deliver something that is beautiful, timeless and one can be proud of. Would definitely recommend."
